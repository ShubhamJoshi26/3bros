                  <h2 class="title">Anniversary Celebration at #3BROS</h2>
                  <p>Celebration with a silver lining – Our 25th wedding celebration at #3BROS. Just like weddings – be it today or years before, celebrating a landmark year in this union is no short of the grandeur. With all our loved ones coming together in this, we’d surely want it to be as memorable as any other special day. When it came to choosing our partners for arranging this event – we couldn’t have gone anywhere but #3BROS

                  <h2 class="title">The Venue Hunt</h2>
                    <p>
                             Due to our professional limitations, we could not engage or devote much time to the planning at large. Our initial visits consisted of visiting large spaces such as banquet and party halls which didn’t serve our purpose because of outdated interiors, escalated costs and one to one interaction with the vendors for all details – from scratch to finish.
                           </p>

                           <p>The dealbreaker was to find a primely located venue in Noida which is optimally priced and could accommodate our guests and our expected arrangements. An ambience with a touch of modernity and a quaint cafe cum party zone for all close-knit gatherings of optimal capacity</p>

<p>Just when we entered #3BROS, the vibe was all of joy and celebration and moments that one can live to the fullest! All of the choices offered for food, various other arrangements such as decor and other provisions from which we could tailor as per our requirements.</p>
<p>With its jazzy interiors, the food options served were vast with 25 cuisines to choose from and all other services fitting our budget. The conceptualization and presentation made us have no second thoughts about our choice</p>

                  <h2 class="title">The D-Day </h2>
                  <p>While we all geared up for the most awaited moment, we were so happy to see all of the decorations done as per the decided theme before time. With all the excitement and giddiness our family surrounded us with, it became like a fairytale wedding eve all over.
                  </p>

<p>The recreation of the Varmala exchange with all the focus on us two made us feel like youths again. The blast of memories pouring on the projector behind, those surprise dance performances by our kids and family members later accompanied by a song dedicated to my better half and a tireless karaoke session after was just all we needed to add so much more to our rejoicing.</p>
           
<p>The team of photographers were at their best capturing those moments that we’d want to revisit always. Also, #3BROS helped us make our distant family a part of it through a live YouTube stream.</p>
<p>That’s not all folks!</p>

                <p>The bar was all set and open serving the best concoctions to offer and the food served stole the limelight, especially the Mahabharat Sizzler giving out taste buds the kick of gourmet food from several places. The delicacies served from start to end were praiseworthy with all the flavours so fresh and measured that made to the liking of everyone, aged 7 to 70.</p>
               <p>All in all, having chosen #3BROS was one of our best decisions and they lived to it beyond all our expectations. It was almost like the #3BROS team was like one extended family of ours who left no stone unturned to make it all smooth and happen.</p>
              <p>With professionalism and all their heart and hard work in it, we knew #3BROS can be a go-to place for any occasion as for them it’s not just a task, it’s a commitment from the heart to fulfil.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Cheers to Team #3BROS</strong></p>
